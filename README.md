##mute.js

A plugin to allow muting of tabs from the command line. <br>
mute is fully functional with or without tabgroups, by QuickSaver: <br>
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-groups-panorama/

`mute` mutes the current tab, while `mute 3` mutes the third visible tab in the group. <br>
(note this follows vimperator's convention of 1-indexing)
