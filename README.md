##mute.js

A plugin to allow muting of tabs from the command line.
It is fully functional with tabgroups, by QuickSaver
(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-groups-panorama/)

`mute` mutes the current tab, while `mute 3` mutes the third visible tab in the group.

note this follows vimperator's convention of 1-indexing.
